            <h2>Erich von Manstein</h2>
            <p> The agreed upon best General of The Third reich,mastermind of Operation Sichelschnitt which was
                Germany's plan to invade France and was able to knock France out of the war in 6 weeks.

            <p>
                On June 6th
                Manstein was in charge of Amry group north During operation babarossa and manage to besiege Leningrad on
                Septemper 8 and Sevastapol on October 30. Manstein was able to take Sevastapol the next year but
                Leningrad was never taken as Hitler wants to starve the city into surrender instead of attacking it as
                he believe it would cost too much troops. </p>
            <img src="../Image/83.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>
                Manstein's biggest mistake was on December 12 1942 at the
                battle of Stallingrad were he believed that The Sixth army encircled inside Stallingrad could holdout
                inside Stallingrad by airdrop supplies and urges Hitler to not order The Sixth Army to break out of
                Stallingrad and that his army could relieve it .However,Manstein's attack was halted on December 23rd 40
                kilometers outside of Stallingrad and was forced to Abandoned the Sixth army,leading to the lost of
                300,000 German troops,and The Wehrmacht pushed out of the Caucasus region of the Soviet Union. </p>
                 <img src="../Image/Eastern_Front_1942-11_to_1943-03.png" alt="">
                <p>By 1943 The Red army had outumbered the Wehrmacht nearly 2-1,Manstein decided instead to taking ground,they
                would inflict heavy casualties to the Red army and negotiate a peace Afterwards and decides to order
                army group south to retreat to Kharkov and counter attack with an encirclement. The plan was successful
                and was alble to inflict 95,000 casualties while only suffering 10,000 casualties. But losing 95,000
                Soviet soldiers out 6 million wasn't going to turn the tide. So Manstein decided the next attack would 
                be and Kursk were he could encircle 500,000 enemy troops if sucessful.Unfortunately, the Soviet Commander 
                Georgy Zhukov was able to predict Manstein's plans and when operation Citadel began,The Red army 
                inflicted 54,000 casualties on the Wehrmacht.While the Wehrmact was inflicted 177,000 casuaties on The Red army,The
                Soviets could more easliy replace their losses while the Wehrmacht had no reserves left. </p>
                <img src="../Image/Battle of Kursk picture.jpeg" alt="">
               <p> The Red army continues to push The Wehrmacht back to the Dnieper river.Hitler would relieve Manstein from command of
                The eastern front on March 30 1944 and He would never hold active command again. </p>

                <p>After the war, Manstein
                was put in court on October 1945 and was charged with executing prisoner of wars on the eastern front,he
                was sentenced to 18 years in prison but it was later commuted to 12 years, He would be realeased on parole 
                in 1953 and died of a stroke in 1973.</p>
